App goal:

The main purpose of this app is to serve as a daily reminder for to do’s set by the user. The main goal is to boost the productivity of the user and lessen the effects of procrastinating with canceling and delaying tasks requiring imputing reasons, making postponing less enticing. 
With this in mind the secondary purpose envisioned is better data visualization, allowing the user to utilize the app in order to keep better organized in their day-to-day life. This visualization is intended to be customizable by the user itself so it best fits the needs and wants of everyone, while ideal this goal might be only partially achieved as the variety of android devices is vast and time is limited.
Least but not last, a ‘velocity’ retrospective of what has been done, and the efficiency of it is one of the functional goals of the app, allowing for a better retrospective on a given time period, giving the user a chance to be proud of their accomplishments and or reflect on what they could have done better.

Requirements (User Stories)

Critical:
1.	As a user, I want to be able to add to do’s to my to do list, so that I can keep track of the things I need and wish to do without having to memorize all of them myself.
2.	As a user, I want to be able to remove to do’s from my to do list so that I can remove tasks no longer needed or desired.
3.	As a user, I want to be able to postpone to do’s form my to do list given a reason, so that I can make room for unforeseen circumstances.
4.	As a user, I want to be able to see my to do’s for the current day, so that I know what needs to be done and when.
5.	As a user, I want to be able to see my to do’s for a set amount of time in the future (weekend, week, month etc.) sot that I can better plan out my future to do’s.
6.	As a user, I want to be able to see my to do’s in multiple formats, including a calendar view and list (much like itslearning), so that I can get a quick overview of my future plans.
